# IMDb Movie Success Prediction Model

Tools Used: Python (SckitLean, MatPlotLib, Pandas, Numpy)

This project focuses on an extensive movie analysis using a diverse sample of movies from the OMDb API, creating machine learning models and visualizations to assist professionals in determining the success of a movie and its influencing factors. A linear regression model was developed to predict box office values based on multiple predictors, and a KMeans clustering algorithm was used to categorize movies into successful and unsuccessful groups, aiding in the identification of common factors within each category.

# Machine Learning Models to Accurately Predict Liver Cirrhosis Stage

Tools Used: Python (SckitLearn, MatPlotLib, Pandas, Numpy)

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the stages of liver cirrhosis based on a dataset with various medical and demographic features. Four classification models (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC)) were trained and tested to determine the most effective approach for accurate predictions.

# Executive Reactions to Cold Calling
[Behaviors of Company Leaders (Data Analysis).pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16369218/Behaviors.of.Company.Leaders.Data.Analysis.pdf)

Tools used: Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning), SQL (Data Querying), Tableau (Data Visualization)

I presented this project to a private equity broker at a previous company I interned at by analyzing his CRM system in Excel filled with information such as dials and pick-ups, locations, positions within their company, and more. With that information, I presented data on information such as what type of executives are most likely to pick up a cold call or what time they would pick up. Providing that analysis, I presented insights to create new strategies that have been successful in business expansion.
