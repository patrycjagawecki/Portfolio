## Introduction

Hi, I’m Patrycja, and I am currently a Data Analyst in Internal Audit. I have a Bachelor of Business Administration in Data Analytics from Baruch College. With a strong interest in technology and data, I am excited to leverage my skills in dynamic fields. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and more. Through various projects, coursework, and practical experiences, I use data to drive solutions and create meaningful impacts.

# Weightlifting Journal Flask Application

[Github Repository Link](https://github.com/patrycjagawecki/WeightLiftingFlaskApplication)

Tools Used: Python (Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Gunicorn, PyMySQL), HTML, Docker, Google Cloud Platform

The goal of this project is to create a full-stack weightlifting journal web application that allows users to log and track their training sessions. Users can record details such as lift date, training day type, exercise name, and weight lifted (in pounds). As a weightlifter outside of my career in data science, I view each lift as part of a larger story of progress, consistency, and experimentation. This project leverages my technical skills to turn that story into a structured, interactive webpage where training data can be logged, explored, and displayed over time. I utilized Python to write a script to create and interact with the database, MySQL to store data, HTML to design the frontend and script form entry, and Google Cloud Platform for deployment and hosting, with data stored in a CloudSQL instance.

# Historical Flight Data Warehouse

[Github Repository Link](https://github.com/patrycjagawecki/HistoricalFlightData)

Tools Used: Azure, Python (Pandas), Snowflake, PowerBI

This project analyzes historical flight data from major U.S. departure airports using an ELT pipeline to uncover insights on delays, cancellations, and peak travel periods. The goal is to inform decision-makers entering the airline market about competitor performance and operational patterns. Over 8 million flight records were processed to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that supports strategic planning and data-driven decision-making.

# IMDb Movie Success Prediction Model

Code: [IMDb Movie Success Prediction Model](https://github.com/patrycjagawecki/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/IMDb%20Movie%20Success%20Prediction%20Model.ipynb)

Tools Used: Python (SckitLean, MatPlotLib, Pandas, Numpy)

This project focuses on an extensive movie analysis using a diverse sample of movies from the OMDb API, creating machine learning models and visualizations to assist professionals in determining the success of a movie and its influencing factors. A linear regression model was developed to predict box office values based on multiple predictors, and a KMeans clustering algorithm was used to categorize movies into successful and unsuccessful groups, aiding in the identification of common factors within each category.

# Machine Learning Models to Accurately Predict Liver Cirrhosis Stage

Code: [Machine Learning Models to Predict Liver Cirrhosis Stage](https://github.com/patrycjagawecki/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Models%20to%20Predict%20Liver%20Cirrhosis%20Stage.ipynb)

Tools Used: Python (SckitLearn, MatPlotLib, Pandas, Numpy)

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the stages of liver cirrhosis based on a dataset with various medical and demographic features. Four classification models (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC)) were trained and tested to determine the most effective approach for accurate predictions.

# Executive Reactions to Cold Calling
[Behaviors of Company Leaders (Data Analysis).pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16369218/Behaviors.of.Company.Leaders.Data.Analysis.pdf)

Tools used: Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning), SQL (Data Querying), Tableau (Data Visualization)

I presented this project to a private equity broker at a previous company I interned at by analyzing his CRM system in Excel filled with information such as dials and pick-ups, locations, positions within their company, and more. With that information, I presented data on information such as what type of executives are most likely to pick up a cold call or what time they would pick up. Providing that analysis, I presented insights to create new strategies that have been successful in business expansion.
