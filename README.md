# Executive Reactions to Cold Calling
[Behaviors of Company Leaders (Data Analysis).pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16369218/Behaviors.of.Company.Leaders.Data.Analysis.pdf)

Tools used: Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning), SQL (Data Querying), Tableau (Data Visualization)

I presented this project to a private equity broker at a previous company I interned at by analyzing his CRM system in Excel filled with information such as dials and pick-ups, locations, positions within their company, and more. With that information, I presented data on information such as what type of executives are most likely to pick up a cold call or what time they would pick up. Providing that analysis, I presented insights to create new strategies that have been successful in business expansion.
