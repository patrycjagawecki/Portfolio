# Data Analytics Portfolio

# Introduction
Hi there! I'm Patrycja, a passionate BBA student majoring in Data Analytics at Baruch College. With a strong interest in marketing and finance, I'm eager to apply my skills and knowledge in these dynamic fields.

I bring hands-on experience with various tools crucial to data analysis and visualization, including Microsoft Excel for data manipulation, Python and SQL for database management and querying, and Tableau and PowerBI for insightful data visualization.

Currently, I am strengthening my skills through practical projects that delve into market research, financial modeling, and consumer behavior analysis, or even fun projects that align with my interests outside of the workplace. My academic coursework has provided me with a solid foundation in statistical analysis and predictive modeling, which I aim to leverage in my future career. 

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me and learn about my background and skills!
